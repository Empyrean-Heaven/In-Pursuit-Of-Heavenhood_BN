# In-Pursuit-Of-Heavenhood_BN
A comprehensive mod for Cataclysm: Bright Nights
### Outline of the Mod
This mod adds 10 new professions, countless new spells, mutations, and items for their respective professions, one standalone mutation, and multiple NPC classes with some capable of casting spells.

Read INDEX.md for information on professions, spells, items, and traits. Read NPCS.md for more information on NPC classes. HOMAGE.md lists the various sources that helped in this mod's creation.

The .md files contain information on the features that were added by me.
### Magiclysm and Magical Nights Compatibility
The mod has modinfo.json and modinfo.txt. The former is for users of Magiclysm and the latter is for users of Magical Nights. If you play with Magical Nights, delete modinfo.json and rename modinfo.txt to modinfo.json. If you play with Magiclysm, no need to change anything.
