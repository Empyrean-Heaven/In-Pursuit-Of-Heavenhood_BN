# Professions with their Spells and Items

### Demon of the Moon Palace
Description: Six hundred years you toiled, toiled under one who was not worthy. An abrupt phenomena shattered the shackles that tethered you to servitude. The emancipation came unanticipated, but such is the passage of life.

Basis: Kokushibo from Demon Slayer.

Unique Item: Godless (a sword that can be used to block bullets).

Unique Power: Has a 1 in 6 chance to summon moonblades to aid him in battle. The moonblades only function in darkness for sunlight destroys them.

Unique Trait: Crescent Six Eyes (has a chance of unleashing a blade of pure will at an enemy, among other things). Do not choose an eye mutation with this profession as it grants one itself.

Unique Spells: Blood Ignition (spill blood in the nearby vicinity and seriously injure those around you), Blood Ambrosia (concentrate all bodily defects like poison into a single limb and remove it), Blood Life Cradle (forcefully cause your flesh to heal by purposefully injuring it), and Blood Sword World (spawn a lot of moonblades).

Unique Martial Art: Lunar Reflection (Superb passive bonuses and the Ten Moon Techniques).

Judgment: Quite possibly the strongest among the ten professions. He has an exceptionally high bonus to dodge, allowing him to evade dozens of attacks every turn. Additionally, his martial art is second to none. His only weakness is that he starts out with subpar skills. Hence, at the base rate he may be defeated by the Destitute Death NPC (profession is Reluctant Renegade, based on Toji Fushigoro from the Jujutsu Kaisen series), the Strongest NPC (profession is The Strongest, based on Gojo Satoru from the Jujutsu Kaisen series), and the Fraud NPC (profession is The Accursed Hegemon, based on Sukuna from the Jujutsu Kaisen series). He also starts with Solar Sensitivity.

### Piccolò Pickle
Description: You survived the meteor. You survived the dinosaurs. You survived mankind. You will survive this disaster as well.

Basis: Pickle from Baki.

Unique Trait: Prehistoric Girth (makes you HUGE, grants unarmed bonuses, gives you physical armor, extra health, healing, and more).

Unique Martial Art: Breath of the Wild (immense defense and block).

Judgment: Among the ten professions, it is somewhere in the middle. You will be strong enough to escape from the likes of Mahoraga and even last a while against him, but ultimately, the fact is Pickle is a pinnacle prehistoric human with no supernatural talents. In a normal setting he would be the apex, but here, he is mediocre.

### Neo, The One
Description: They called you a madman but look where we are now. Will you escape the matrix again, Neo?

Basis: Neo from the Matrix trilogy.

Unique Power: Just a load of CBMs.

Judgment: Arguably the weakest among the ten professions. You just start out with powerful and numerous CBMs.

### Jotaro Joestar
Description: A cruel fate has enveloped these lands, but with your Stand, you are nonplussed.

Basis: Jotaro Kujo from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

Unique Trait: Stand Proud (grants the Wonder of U effect, which has a 50% of activating every time you are melee attacked and hits the attacker with 80 fire damage).

Unique Spells: Star Platinum (summons a buff blue macho man to aid you in combat), The World (grants you up to 36 whole seconds of extra time), King Crimson (invisible and invulnerable for a time while every other creature nearby gets The World), and Maiden Heaven (distorts the placement of NPCs and monsters, could prove fatal).

Judgment: An upper tier profession for sure. Wonder of U is a great passive ability and his spells provide adequate buffs to the player.

### The Strongest
Description: Are you the strongest because you're the player? Or are you the player because you're the strongest?

Basis: Gojo Satoru from Jujutsu Kaisen.

Unique Trait: Sorceror Supreme (250 damage reduction for everything, 2.5 times mana and mana regen).

Unique Spells: Limitless Void (blanket an area in darkness and cause everyone caught in it to experience a lobotomy besides you for 64 seconds), Cursed Energy Reversal (heal your wounds), Cursed Reverberation (spread out your injuries to all limbs), Cursed Blue (bring everything to the center of the spell), Cursed Red (expel outwards all things caught in the spell), Cursed Purple (cast a straight line of pure damage), and Boogie Woogie (exchange locations with another).

Unique Items: Cursed Palm (great unarmed weapon), and Fashionable Blindfold (clairvoyance).

Judgment: The contender for the strongest profession, going toe-to-toe with The Accursed Hegemon. The reason why he may be supreme is because of his 250 armor, Limitless Void, and Cursed Purple.

### The Accursed Hegemon
Description: In centuries past, ye overcame mortality and achieved divinity. Albeit a demigod, you certainly were no longer human. However, forsooth it seems now nothing is either.

Basis: Sukuna from Jujutsu Kaisen.

Unique Trait: Madgod (a lot of health and some mana and mana regen).

Unique Spells: Omnidirectional Dismantle (unleash 40 attacks per cast and cause on average 1,800 damage), Malevolent Shrine (cause 30 damage per second to everything caught in it besides you for 64 seconds), and Summon Mahoraga (summons the most powerful monster to quite possibly grace the Cataclysm, has a chance to be hostile).

Judgment: Funnily enough, the only professions capable of taking down Mahoraga may be The Accursed Hegemon and max power The Strongest. Mahoraga has 1,111 hp and regenrates 111 hp per turn. Malevolent Shrine does nothing to it. Omnidirectional Dismantle can take it down. Maximum Cursed Purple may take down Mahoraga in a single cast. Through extensive testing, I found out basically nothing survives Malevolent Shrine.

### Reluctant Renegade
Description: The patriarch was adamant that the bloodline remain pure and removed from taint. You were taint. Out of necessity, you massacred your clan. If heaven has eyes, how are you still alive? O heathen wretched may ye be, a wandering wicked beast.

Basis: Toji Fushigoro from Jujutsu Kaisen.

Unique Trait: Forgotten by Fate 『天外人』 (a powerful buff to dodge, can survive a long time without food, erases mana, and gives a 1 in 4 chance of unsafely teleporting closeby when melee attacked).

Unique Items: Soulrend (heals the player when attacking another, great throwing weapon), Mountain's Descent (a flail and axe tied together by a chain, an incredibly strong weapon), and Muted Yukata (a simple yukata with a surprisingly large storage space).

Judgment: Second only to the Demon of the Moon Palace. He gains a new technique when using his weapons too. Can easily contend against Mahoraga, but not quite kill it swiftly. This profession cannot use mana magic or mutagens.

### Anachronistic Penitent
Description: For them, you did what you could. But, where did that leave you?

Basis: Atlas from Greek Mythology.

Unique Trait: Atlas (Proto, Tokos, Homo, Gigant, and Divus). The five forms of Atlas give respective buffs and advantages. The most powerful is Atlas Divus which turns you unkillable.

Judgment: An interesting profession. You can adapt accordingly to myriad situations. Not particularly strong in the offensive department.

### Heaven Plunderer
Description: At first, it started small. But then you realized your god-given talent. One thing led to another, and now, here we are.

Basis: Doesn't really have a direct basis. Sort of loosely based on Kaito Kid from Detective Conan and Hakari from Jujutsu Kaisen.

Unique Trait: Boombastic (spawn a bomb to hurl at enemies).

Unique Items: Stolen Hammer (Thor's hammer, great damage, very heavy, intriguing artifact), Beyond Infinity (a gauntlet that creates portals, recharges while worn on its own), and Otherworldly Skeleton Key (best lockpick and safecracker around).

Unique Spells: Love Is An Open Door (turn any wall into an unlocked wooden door), Extra Dimensional Traversal (place a downspout on any flat terrain), Yellow Brick Road (place a yellow carpet on open air and liquid terrain), And That's All Folks (turn any flat terrain into open air), Truman's Glass Cage (surround anything with a glass cage), Lovey Dovey Super Lucky (turn enemy monsters into allies for a short while), Where Angels Fear To Tread (target teleport to a location, if cast on open air you can levitate), and Idle Gambler's Last Waltz (1 in 216 chance of hitting a jackpot which grants 777 hp healing, 777 pain erasure, and 777 good mood for a bit, with higher chances of either failing to get any reward or receiving a Common, Rare, or Penultimate reward).

Judgment: Definitely the most fun profession out of the ten. An enjoyable experience all around.

### Penultimate Organism
Description: The culmination of a hundred-thousand years of toil has been nearly achieved. There is now only one step between you and the absolute.

Basis: Kars from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

Unique Spells: Becoming Human, Bear, Plant, Insect, Spider, Slime, Fish, Rat, Wolf, Cow, Cephalopod, Bird, Lizard, Prototype, Chimera, Fey, and Mouse (gain threshold mutations for each spell and when you reach Level 5 in any spell you gain a new spell called Becoming Empyrean which turns you into an Empyrean, a being who refuses to die).

Judgment: A unique playstyle awaits. With Empyrean, one may possibly survive a Malevolent Shrine attack.

# Standalone Traits and Spells

### Conjoined Soul (Trait, Can Be Chosen At The Starting Screen)
Description: You had a birthright secret you revealed to no other. You were born with two souls in one body. The dichotomy early on was detrimental to your mental fortitude, but you pushed on, and at last, the voices died down to become one singular voice.

Unique Spells: Separation of the Souls (astral project yourself out of your body, it leaves an item called your corpse which you need to craft an item with to become material again, and in this state you have close to 0 carry weight, can wear nothing, and are untraceable and undamageable besides for electric damage which harms you fatally), and Sacrifice of the Souls (destroy one of your souls to heal a great amount while falling into a coma).
