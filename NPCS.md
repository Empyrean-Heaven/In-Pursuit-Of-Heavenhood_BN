# Introduction
The mods adds several NPC classes, some of which are capable of casting spells. They are nearly mirror images of their respective player professions.

### Lunar Demon
Equivalent to the profession Demon of the Moon Palace. Can cast moonblades but it is also hostile to the NPC so it may result in ludicrous scenarios.

### Prehistoric Sapien
Equivalent to the profession Piccol√≤ Pickle. Exactly the same as it besides the NPC being unable to use Breath of the Wild.

### The Chosen One
Equivalent to the profession Neo, The One. Has a lot of CBMs installed.

### Child of Jotaro
Equivalent to the profession Jotaro Joestar. Can cast Star Platinum (hostile to player and NPC), The World, King Crimson, and Maiden Heaven.

### The Strongest
Equivalent to the profession The Strongest. Can cast Limitless Void (instant death even for a super mutant player), Cursed Red, Cursed Blue, and Cursed Purple (150 pure damage).

### The Fraud
Equivalent to the profession The Accursed Hegemon. Can cast Malevolent Shrine (unless Atlas Divus or Empyrean, fatal), and Summon Mahoraga (hostile to player and NPC).

### Destitute Death
Equivalent to the profession Reluctant Renegade. Insanely strong. Can occasionally teleport.
